# House-Price-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict California house prices.
This project predicts housing prices using Machine Learning. The notebook (Housing_Model.ipynb) applies data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and compares Linear Regression with Random Forest models.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots

Model training and evaluation (MSE, MAE, R²)

Visualizations: feature importance, prediction comparison (scatter, bar chart, heatmap)
Results

Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Linear Regression

Feature importance highlights key factors affecting housing prices

Visual comparisons show model performance clearly
